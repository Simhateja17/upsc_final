${answerText}

${ocrNote ? "NOTE: This text was OCR-extracted from a handwritten sheet. Grade content rigorously but forgive minor spelling/OCR artifacts.\n\n" : ""}GRADING RULES — follow precisely:
- Empty / single-line / gibberish / off-topic answers → score 0-1. Do not reward effort.
- Answer that rephrases the question without substance → 2-4 out of ${question.marks}.
- Answer with some valid points but missing core demand, no examples, no structure → 5-7 out of ${question.marks}.
- Answer that addresses the question directly, has clear structure (intro/body/conclusion), relevant facts, but is incomplete or one-sided → 8-10 out of ${question.marks}.
- Well-structured, multi-dimensional, with specific examples (reports/schemes/data/committees/case studies), balanced conclusion → 11-13 out of ${question.marks}.
- Reserve 14-${question.marks} ONLY for exceptional answers: precise directive (examine/discuss/critically analyze) addressed, original insight, contemporary linkage, committee/data references, crisp conclusion. A topper-level answer.
- Penalize if word count is wildly off (>50% over or under ~${expectedWords}).
- Penalize factual errors heavily. If a claim is wrong, call it out in "improvements".
- NEVER give pity marks. A blank or one-sentence answer should not get more than 1/${question.marks}.

Rubric weights (for your internal reasoning; surface in metrics):
1. Relevance to directive & question demand (30%)
2. Content depth, accuracy, and factual correctness (25%)
3. Structure & organization — intro, body with sub-headings/points, conclusion (15%)
4. Examples, data, committees, schemes, case studies (15%)
5. Balance of perspectives / multi-dimensional analysis (10%)
6. Language clarity & concision (5%)
